# MC3DS-BJE
- **MC3DS-BJE can interpret Minecraft3DS' .bjson Format, and turn it into Compatible C-Headers, JSON, and YAML.**

## Note(s):
- **Currently only MC3DS Fonts are being used for research, but most files have patterns very very similar to what the sript goes after.**

## Roadmap(s):
1. **Support more than just MC3DS Fonts including, Sounds, Entity Data, UI Elements, and Structure Data.**
2. **Support for exporting into Multiple DataTypes.**
3. **Compiling back into the .bjson Format.**
4. **Support for .bson/.yaml/.ini files into .json or .bjson Formats.**
